Application of Convolution Neural Network in Emergency Vehicle Classification



This study investigates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify emergency and non-emergency vehicles, aiming to improve traffic management during emergencies. Using a dataset of 1,646 labeled images, CNN models were developed, with the best-performing model achieving 83% accuracy. While the model effectively identified non-emergency vehicles, its recall for emergency vehicles was lower. The results highlight CNNs' potential for real-world applications in traffic systems, with future improvements possible through techniques like transfer learning.
